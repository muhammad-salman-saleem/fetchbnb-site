The registration can be completed online and does not require more than a few minutes. New registrations require a fee of $50.\n\nThe Park Board provides an online system to report and pay taxes on a monthly or quarterly basis. Vacation rentals which generate $500 in taxes per month or $1,500 per quarter can report quarterly. The rest have to file their taxes monthly. Importantly, a report has to be submitted even if a property did not generate any revenue over a reporting period. Otherwise, the host faces a fine of $25.\n\nThe Galveston hotel occupancy tax rate is equivalent to 9% charges on gross revenue which includes the nightly rental rate, cleaning fee, pet fee, smoking fee, damages, and others.\n\nWhen listing a property on platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo which remit the state hotel occupancy tax, city taxes are also collected and remitted by them.\n\nOverall, Galveston is one of the most Airbnb friendly cities in the Texas short term rental market.",

Now Ordinance 22-7 limits this type of rentals to designated areas only, to increase the supply of long-term rentals and homes for sale.\n\nThere are two types of Honolulu short-term rentals:\n\nBed and breakfast homes (B&Bs), where the homeowner or permanent resident is present during the short-term stay. They can rent a maximum of two rooms per property out, with a maximum occupancy of two adult transient occupants per room.\nTransient vacation units (TVUs), also called whole homes or unhosted rentals. The maximum occupancy per room is two adult guests.\nThe areas where Honolulu Airbnb properties of either type can legally operate under the new ordinance include:\n\nThe areas within the Apartment Precinct on the Waikiki Special District Mauka of Kuhio Avenue\nThe areas within A-1 low-density apartment zoning district and A-2 medium-density apartment zoning district in proximity to the Ko Olina Resort\nThe areas within A-1 low-density apartment zoning district in proximity to the Turtle Bay Resort\nB&Bs and TVUs which were being rented for periods from 30 consecutive days to 89 consecutive days prior to October 23, 2022 can continue operating as short-term rentals until April 23, 2023. After this date, they have to stop leasing, convert into long-term rentals, or register as short-term rentals under the new ordinance, provided that they meet all requirements.\n\nIn order to operate as an Oahu or Honolulu vacation rental, a property needs to be registered.\n\nThe registration of an Honolulu, Hawaii short-term rental requires the following documents:\n\nRegistration form to be provided by the responsible department\nRecent title report\nValid current State of Hawaii general excise tax license and transient accommodation tax license\nValid current city transient accommodation tax license\nEvidence of a real property home tax exemption for a B&B\nEvidence of at least 50% interest in the subject property for a B&B\nEvidence that the use as a B&B home or TVU is covered by an insurance carrier\nConfirmation that the short-term rental is permitted by the HOA or other relevant regime articles, bylaws, or house rules\nEvidence that the dwelling unit is not an affordable unit subject to income restrictions, did not receive housing or rental assistance subsidies, and was not subject to an eviction within the last 12 months\nInitial registration fee of $1,000\nHonolulu short-term rental registrations are valid for a year, and they have to be renewed annually for a fee of $500. The initial registration fee and the annual renewal fee in this Hawaii city are significantly higher than in other top locations for vacation rental investing across the US. This cost is something investors need to include in their calculations before buying a property in order to make sure that their Airbnb cap rate is good.\n\nAnother expense which Airbnb hosts need to take into consideration is the 3% city TAT.\n\nOver all, Honolulu and Oahu short-term rental laws are rather limiting because of restrictions on allowed locations. They make running an Honolulu Airbnb business expensive.

Wisconsin Act 59 prohibits local jurisdictions\nfrom prohibiting stays between 7 and 29 days and sets parameters for other regulations.\nAfter months of review and consideration, the County Zoning Agency developed a short term rental\nlicensing requirement. The ordinance requiring a license was adopted by the Walworth County Board of\nSupervisors on April 19, 2018. The license regulates things such as occupancy of the rental, parking,\ngarbage pickup, quiet hours, and identifies a responsible party to contact in the event of an emergency or\nif there is a complaint about a renter.

    "County:": "Arlington",
    "State:": "Virginia",
    "Policy point 1:": "A short-term residential rental is proposed to be a home occupation in which an owner who occupies a dwelling unit as his/her primary residence, rents out that dwelling unit, or portion thereof, to a lodger. The lodger must compensate the host for the stay. No individual lodger may rent lodging in the same dwelling unit for more than 30 days in one year. The Zoning Ordinance would refer to short-term residential rental as “accessory homestay,” and would be added to the list of home occupations that are allowed within a residential dwelling by a person(s) who uses the dwelling unit as his/her principal residence.",
    "Policy point 2:": "There are several provisions in the Zoning Ordinance that regulate what is allowed for each use. The Zoning Ordinance includes use tables articulating what uses are allowed in each zoning district; the Ordinance works such that if a use is not expressly permitted, that means it is prohibited.  With respect to residential uses, “dwelling unit” is defined by the Zoning Ordinance as a use allowed exclusively for residential occupancy.  The use classification system in the Zoning Ordinance classifies residential use under the “Household Living” category, which describes residential occupancy as use of a dwelling by a family, with tenancy arranged on a month-to month or longer basis; and articulates that uses where tenancy is arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential.  Residential units arranged for short term stays of less than 30 days for rent or lease are classified in the “overnight accommodations” category, and allowed only in buildings that are expressly approved for a hotel (which is allowed as a matter of right in some zoning districts, and requires special exception site plan approval by the County Board in other Zoning districts), or a bed & breakfast (which is allowed only in one-family zoning districts, and requires special exception use permit approval by the County Board).",
    "Policy point 3:": "How many properties in Arlington are currently doing this despite it being prohibited by zoning code? How many are in multi-family buildings? Staff does not have exact numbers or locations, as listing services do not make addresses available.  Data available on AirDNA (a site that compiles information from Airbnb) indicated that between August and September 2016, there were between 900-1600 listing in the County.  However, these data represent only one listing service, so it is possible that there are other properties listed on other services.",
    "Policy point 4:": "Why should the County regulate short term residential rentals? Why now? Recently, use of online residential, short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, Craigslist, and other services, have become more prevalent in Arlington and nationwide. Data collected in September 2016 from AirDNA shows that Arlington had 986 properties listed on Airbnb. However, the Arlington County Zoning Ordinance does not currently allow short-term residential rentals. The zoning office has received both questions about how to conduct this use legally, as well as complaints about existing short-term residential rentals. Zoning regulations governing short-term residential rentals will enable the County to address problems and concerns if they arise, and provide standards to allow the use in a manner that protects public health and safety and the character of residential neighborhoods.\n\nThe reason for considering an amendment now is that in 2016, the Virginia General Assembly considered legislation that would have precluded local governments from enforcing local zoning laws restricting the establishment of short-term residential rentals in any zoning district where residential uses are permitted. It would also have kept the identity of short-term rental properties hidden and precluded local governments from collecting and auditing Transient Occupancy Taxes, as they would for any other lodging property. A version of the legislation passed in the 2016 session, but the Governor referred it to the Virginia Housing Commission to study and create draft legislation for consideration in the 2017 session. The Virginia Housing Commission has created the Short-Term Rental Work Group for this purpose. By acting this year, Arlington will have an opportunity to potentially inform the legislation considered by the General Assembly in 2017.\n\nAre commercial activities already allowed in residential districts? How are short term residential rentals different from the commercial activities already allowed? Residential zoning districts include single-family (R) districts and multiple-family (RA) districts. Only a limited number of commercial uses are allowed, and only in a limited capacity in residential zoning districts.\n\nHome occupations are a limited commercial use allowed in all residential dwelling units in R, RA and in commercial/mixed use (C) districts. A home occupation is an accessory use that is allowed to be conducted in a dwelling unit used by a person as his/her principal residence.  Examples of home occupations include a home office/studio of an artist, author, contractor, craftsperson, repair workshop, etc.  Short-term residential rental is proposed to be regulated as a home occupation, and like home occupations, would be allowed as accessory to a person’s principal residency in the dwelling and subject to certain limitations.\n\nIn addition to home occupations, residential zoning districts also allow some principal commercial uses, subject to special exception use permit approval by the County Board:\n\nFederal, state and local offices: allowed in R and RA districts\nBed and breakfasts: allowed in R districts only, subject to certain limitations.  There are no approved Bed and Breakfasts in the County, however, there is one proposed Bed and Breakfast scheduled for review by the County Board at its November 5, 2016 meeting.\nOpen-air markets, which include farmers’ markets and flea markets held periodically on a regular basis: allowed in R and RA districts, subject to certain limitations.\nMedical and dental offices in R and RA districts, only when located in existing institutional buildings located on primary or secondary arterials; or in RA districts within existing multiple-family buildings, or in new buildings, only when such building retains the exterior appearance of a residential building",

    "Policy point 1:": "The Morgan County short-term vacation rental ordinance outlines the guidelines and requirements for property owners or lessees who wish to offer their residential unit or any portion of it for rent for fewer than 30 consecutive days. The purpose of the ordinance is to provide safe, clean, and welcoming accommodations for visitors.\n\nTo operate a short-term vacation rental in Morgan County, a business license and short-term rental permit must be obtained from the county. The license will be issued upon payment of necessary fees and a finding by the staff that the review criteria have been satisfied. The licensee must be the property owner or lessee, and a local representative must be designated as an emergency and nuisance complaint contact.\n\nThe application procedure requires property owner/lessee information, a sales tax collection and accounting number, the street address of each unit, the local representative's name, address, and telephone number available 24/7, and other information requested on the application forms. The licensee must supplement both the cover form and unit forms as information changes or units change managers.\n\nAs a condition of holding a valid license, the owner/lessee must provide or arrange for adequate property management services. Minimum services and management include snow removal, summer yard maintenance, structural maintenance, routine upkeep, trash collection, and short-term rental website use. On-street parking for short-term vacation rental uses must not obstruct traffic or public safety.\n\nNo outdoor display of goods and merchandise or signs advertising or pertaining to the short-term vacation rental are permitted. Short-term vacation rentals may not be used for commercial uses not otherwise permitted in the zone, nor converted to corporate sponsor or business houses used primarily to distribute retail products or personal services to invitees for marketing or similar purposes, regardless of whether such products or services are charged for.\n\nThe owner of rentals under this section is responsible for regulating the occupancy of the unit and noise created by the occupants. Failure to comply with designated off-street parking, illegal conduct, or any other abuse that violates any law regarding use or occupancy of the premises is grounds for revocation of the short-term vacation rental license and permit. Failure to collect and deposit sales and transit room tax is also a violation of the license and grounds for revocation.\n\nIn determining whether to issue a business license for short-term vacation rental, the application will be reviewed to ensure compliance with the Code for Abatement of Dangerous Buildings and other applicable standards and conditions. The unit must be located within a designated zone and subzone that allows rentals during the license period. The applicant will bear the cost of any required inspection or reinspection.",

The maximum number of adults allowed to stay in a short-term residential rental is six, and the maximum number of adults allowed per bedroom is two. Each rental contract requires one off-street parking space unless the online listing indicates that vehicle parking is prohibited.\n\nWhen the owner or authorized resident is absent, the maximum rental days per calendar year are limited to 120. However, there is no limit if the owner or authorized resident is present. To obtain a license, owners must first notify their immediate neighbors and their homeowners'/condominium association, if there are any, that they plan to rent out their home or unit. The application process also requires certification that all relevant parties have been notified.\n\nIn addition, property owners must comply with zoning restrictions and must keep a record of the guests who stay in the rental property. Licenses are issued for one year and require an annual application to be renewed. Once a license is issued, property owners are required to post their license number on Airbnb or other short-term rental websites, along with their listing, to rent their home or a room in their home.

    "Policy point 1:": "Short-term lodging, also known as vacation rental, refers to the occupancy of a dwelling for a period of less than 30 days. It includes renting out a room or the entire property to travelers, tourists, and other visitors. The rise of short-term lodging platforms such as Airbnb and VRBO has led to increased demand for regulations to manage the impact on neighborhoods and communities.\n\nIn most zoning districts, short-term lodging is allowed as an accessory use in all types of dwellings, including single-family homes, townhouses, condos, manufactured homes, and apartments. However, a permit is required and must be obtained from the Zoning Administrator. The permit is valid for two years from the date of issuance.\n\nTo obtain a permit, an application must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator on a form furnished by the county. The administrator will issue the permit if the application meets the requirements of the ordinance. The application must demonstrate that the short-term lodging operator meets the requirements, including being a permanent resident of the property, obtaining written consent from the owner of the property, assuming responsibility for checking regulations and covenants, and designating an authorized agent.\n\nThe dwelling or manufactured home used for short-term lodging must comply with the requirements of the applicable version of the US Building Code (USBC) or Virginia Manufactured Home Safety Regulations, as determined by the Building Official. It must also have a working multi-purpose fire extinguisher, interconnected smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors (when required for a fireplace or gas service). The operator must post a plan inside the door to each sleeping room showing the exit pathway from the sleeping room to the nearest exit from the dwelling or manufactured home. In addition, the operator must have one designated off-street parking space available for lodgers, which the operator has the authority to reserve for short-term lodging purposes.\n\nThe short-term lodging use is subject to limitations, including a maximum of 60 nights per calendar year. The maximum number of lodgers per night may not exceed six adults, except where the USBC requires fewer occupants. All lodgers occupying a short-term lodging must be associated with the same rental contract. The maximum number of rental contracts per night is one. Events and activities, including luncheons, banquets, parties, weddings, meetings, fundraising, commercial or advertising activities, and any other gathering of persons other than the authorized lodgers, whether for direct or indirect compensation, are prohibited in association with any short-term lodging.\n\nAll advertisements for short-term lodging, posted on any platform online or in any other format, must include the short-term lodging permit number and identify the location of the parking space required by subsection (2)(d) and any other available parking or public transportation options. A short-term lodging operator must maintain a guest log including the name, address, and telephone number of all overnight lodgers. The guest log must be made available upon request to any county employee or agent tasked with enforcing the Zoning Ordinance or other applicable part of the County Code.\n\nShort-term lodging is prohibited in a detached accessory structure, accessory living unit, temporary family health care structure, affordable dwelling unit, or workforce dwelling unit. The Zoning Administrator’s issuance of a permit does not invalidate any other provision of federal, state, or local law, any restrictive covenant, or any property owners’ association by-law.\n\nIn summary, short-term lodging is a popular way for property owners to generate income, but it requires a permit and compliance with regulations to ensure the safety of guests and minimize the impact on neighborhoods and communities.",

    "Policy point 1:": "The article discusses the changing nature of lodging in recent years, with many property owners opting to rent out their homes or other properties as short-term rentals to transient guests. This trend has given rise to short-term rental services like Airbnb and VRBO. However, short-term rentals pose unique challenges that are not present in traditional forms of lodging or single-family occupancy. As a result, Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance regulates short-term rentals in unincorporated areas of the county.\n\nThe Montgomery County Code defines a Short-Term Tourist Rental as a single-family dwelling or portion of it that is rented out to short-term transient guests for compensation. The owner does not live on the same or adjacent property. Short-Term Tourist Rentals are allowed by-right in the A-1 Agricultural Zoning District and by a Special Use Permit in RR, R1, R2, R3, and RM-1.\n\nThe Zoning Ordinance also outlines regulations that must be followed when operating a Short-Term Tourist Rental. These include maximum occupancy limits determined by permit approval from the Virginia Department of Health, designated parking areas, clear property boundaries, fire safety requirements, and a property management plan demonstrating how the rental will be managed, and how the impact on neighboring properties will be minimized. Owners must also provide an emergency evacuation plan, a connection to local phone service, and comply with outdoor burning regulations.\n\nAdditionally, individuals offering property for short-term rental must ensure that all applicable meals and lodging taxes are paid to the county by contacting the Montgomery County Commissioner of the Revenue. Finally, if the property is located within a subdivision governed by a homeowners' association/property owners' association, the Planning Department must receive a written recommendation of approval or disapproval from the HOA/POA to operate the short-term rental.",

The regulations permit STLs by-right in the RA (Rural Areas), RP (Residential Performance), and MH1 (Mobile Home Community) Districts with an approved administrative permit. According to the county's zoning ordinance, an STL refers to the occupancy of all or part of a dwelling, including a mobile home, for 30 days or less. However, structures like campers, tents, yurts, or other non-dwelling buildings that do not meet the building code definition of a dwelling cannot be used as STL units.\n\nIf short-term lodging is permitted in a district, there are several requirements that must be met. First, the maximum number of lodgers per night must not exceed 10 unrelated individuals, unless the Uniform Statewide Building Code limits the number of occupants. Second, no more than five guestrooms are allowed for STLs. Third, only one rental contract for a short-term lodging dwelling unit per night is permitted, and all lodgers occupying the dwelling unit must be associated with the same rental contract. Fourth, a dwelling or manufactured home used for STL must comply with applicable versions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code or Virginia Manufactured Home Safety Regulations and be available for inspection by the county during reasonable hours.\n\nFifth, a dwelling or manufactured home used for short-term lodging must have working multi-purpose fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors (when required for a fireplace or gas service). Sixth, a plan must be posted inside the door of each sleeping room showing the exit pathway from the sleeping room used for short-term lodging to the nearest exit from the dwelling or manufactured home. Seventh, there must be at least two designated off-street parking spaces available for lodgers that the operator can reserve for short-term lodging purposes. Eighth, special events, as defined by the county's zoning ordinance, are prohibited in association with short-term lodging use.\n\nFinally, those interested in establishing a short-term lodging operation or those already operating without a permit must complete the following applications before starting the use: a short-term lodging administrative permit, which costs $200 and is reviewed and approved by the Planning and Development Department, and a business license, which is reviewed and approved by the Commissioner of the Revenue (COR).",

An owner must have an individual permit for each property and/or unit even if they are located within the same dwelling. Moreover, permits are not transferable or assignable to other people. Short Term Rental Permits have to be renewed on an annual basis, for a non-refundable renewal fee of $75.\nWhen submitting an application, you need to provide:\nInformation about the owner of the property including the name, address, email address, and phone number;\nAddress of the short term rental;\nContact information of the Short Term Rental Agent including the name, address, email address, and phone number. Each vacation rental in the Memphis real estate market needs to have one or more designated Rental Agents who are reasonably available to handle issues and are able to appear on the property within 2 hours of receiving a notification. The Agent also needs to monitor compliance with regulations;\nSworn acknowledgement of understanding the rules by the owner;\nMaximum number of occupants;\nAgreement by the owner to do their best to ensure that the short term rental will not disrupt the neighborhood;\nSworn Code Compliance Verification Form by the owner;\nProof of ownership;\nProof of hazard and liability insurance for a minimum of $1 million;\nNon-refundable application fee of $75.\nAirbnb hosts need to comply with the following Memphis, Tennessee short term rental regulations:\nAssuring that all occupants abide by all applicable noise control restrictions and garbage collection and disposal provisions;\nMeeting all applicable state and local building and fire safety codes including fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors;\nProviding only packaged, sealed, and nonperishable food and beverages to guests;\nDisplaying the Agent’s name and telephone number on the property in a clear manner.\nThe fact that non-owner occupied short term rentals are unrestricted in Memphis distinguishes it from other major cities and top Airbnb locations across the US. Considering the popularity of Bluff City and these favorable short term rental rules, you should give this market a serious thought.",

This requires the payment of a non-refundable application fee of $150.\nBeing approved for a non-owner occupied short term rental is relatively more complicated. It requires that adjacent property owners owning land within 300 feet of your property provide any concerns or objections that they might have, in writing. Furthermore, a copy of your application will be mailed or emailed to the neighborhood association, if applicable, and the Council member representing the district of your property. In addition, the Fire Marshal and a City Building inspector will be notified to ensure that the property complies with state and local laws.\nCertificate applications must designate a short term vacation rental agent who is reasonably available to handle any problems and able to appear on the property within 2 hours after receiving a notification from the City.\nOperating without a certificate as well as other violations will be penalized with a fee of $50 per violation per day.\nChattanooga short term vacation rental certifications need to be renewed annually provided that none of the previously provided information has changed. The annual renewal fee is $150.\nThe City of Chattanooga also imposes maximum occupancy requirements. The maximum occupancy should not exceed 2 persons per bedroom of 210 square foot plus 2 additional persons. Larger rooms can host more guests, following a clear rule.\nOther requirements that Chattanooga Airbnb hosts need to meet include:\nComplying with all applicable laws related to zoning, building, health, and safety;\nProviding adequate on-site parking;\nAssuring that all occupants abide by all applicable noise restrictions and waste management provisions;\nPosting the name and phone number of the owner or the agent within the rental;\nNot being part of an Affordable Housing PILOT Program.\nIf you are considering buying an Airbnb property in the City of Chattanooga, you should keep in mind that there has been a lot of talk and action towards imposing stricter rules and regulations. In specific, in the spring of 2022 the City Council approved a rule to pause all new applications for non-owner occupied short term vacation rentals. If enacted, this moratorium will last until January 2023 to provide the City Council with sufficient time to develop further regulations which address growing resident concerns.\nSo, make sure to keep an eye on developments in this regard before investing in a Tennessee short term rental property in Chattanooga.",

    "Policy point 2:": "On August 22, 2022, the City of Columbia Heights adopted a twelve-month interim ordinance establishing a moratorium on new rental licenses for single-family residential structures. In early 2022, the City Council began discussions of a rental density cap over concerns that it has become increasingly difficult for potential home buyers wishing to purchase property in the City to identify financially attainable options. Many such options are quickly purchased by remote corporate entities and converted to rental properties. Further, the City is concerned that the overall number of rental properties in the City has increased at an unsustainable rate. In addition, the City is aware of possible shortcomings within City Code relating to provisions governing rental licenses and property maintenance and would like to be more proactive in securing compliance for the health, safety, and welfare of City residents generally.\n\nThe City Council passed the moratorium to afford city staff the time and space to determine the current makeup and status of the rental housing stock within the city, determine the effect and feasibility of creating a rental density cap on single family residences, and consider whether the city has sufficient staffing, resources, and processes to establish and maintain a rental density cap.\n\nThe moratorium does not apply to: (a) any complete rental license application submitted to the City on or before August 22, 2022; (b) any application for renewal of an existing rental license; (c) any application already approved or in the process of approval by the City. Any application submitted and received prior to August 22, 2022, but deemed incomplete by the City, shall be returned to the applicant, along with the application fee, and no resubmission of such application shall be accepted during the moratorium.\n\nIt’s important for Single-family Rental Licensees to understand that during the moratorium period, rental licenses of single-family properties that are revoked, terminated, or expire for failure to renew are ineligible to apply for a new rental license until the moratorium has ended.",

A separate permit is needed for each individual unit. Moreover, permits are not transferable.\nOperating an Airbnb business without a permit can result in a minimum fine of $500 per violation per day.\nSimilar to other Texas markets, San Antonio vacation rental hosts are expected to pay a hotel occupancy tax.

Property owners, their agents, or long term tenants can operate a vacation rental business provided that they obtain a short term rental license. An individual can obtain up to two licenses, where one of the dwelling units has to be their primary residence, without any additional requirements, permits, zoning, fees, or other restrictions.\n\nImportantly, the license for the primary residence has to be received first, but the primary residence does not have to be actively rented out on a short term basis for a second dwelling unit to be licensed and rented out.\n\nShort term rental license applications can be submitted online, and it takes up to 10 business days to get the license.\n\nSubmitting an application requires the following information:\n\nThe address of the short term rental unit\nThe agent/24-hour contact person information including name, address, phone number, and email address\nAcknowledgement signed by the agent that they have read and understand the requirements\nThe number and location of available parking spaces\nAgreement by the agent to put the necessary efforts to ensure that the short term rental does not disturb the neighbors\nCopy of the written rules posted in the short term rental unit\nNon-refundable application fee of $150\nIn addition to paying the state sales tax, Atlanta Airbnb hosts have to collect and remit a 7% hotel-motel tax unless that’s done by the platform through which they rent out.\n\nThe adoption of these recent Atlanta short term rental laws has made operating a non-owner occupied vacation rental more tricky.

A short-term rental is defined as any residential building, apartment, single family dwelling, two family dwelling, condo, townhouse, guest house, cottage, cabin, or accessory dwelling rented in whole or in part for less than 30 consecutive nights. The regulations exclude timeshares but include rooming houses and boarding houses.\n\nTo start an Airbnb business in Lake Placid, a short-term rental permit is required. The permit application process includes submitting information about all property owners, a notarized affidavit certifying compliance with various requirements, and a site plan. The applicant must also provide information about the number of rooms and parking spaces meeting standards, a septic inspection report, a contact person who is available 24/7, and provisions for weekly garbage removal. Additionally, the applicant must comply with all standards and regulations, register with the Occupancy Tax Program, pay a permit fee, and display the house number visible from the street. Owner-occupied short-term rentals rented out for up to 14 days in a calendar year are exempt from paying the permit fee. Only one permit per property can be issued, and permits are valid for two years but not transferable to new property owners.\n\nIn the Village of Lake Placid, a short-term rental property can be rented out for only 90 days per calendar year, while this limit extends to 120 days for properties outside the corporate limits of the Village. Failing to adhere to vacation rental regulations will result in a fine of $350-$1,000 for the first offense and $1,000-$3,000 for the second offense.\n\nThe Village of Lake Placid and the Town of North Elba have recently introduced a moratorium on all new applications for short-term rental permits. A special committee has been formed to study the local Airbnb market and suggest changes to the existing law. The committee has recommended allowing hosted short-term rentals anywhere in Lake Placid and North Elba while prohibiting unhosted short-term rentals in residential districts, with some exceptions. Additionally, they have proposed allowing unhosted short-term rentals in the village center, the gateway corridor, the Old Military Road corridor, and the rural countryside district. The committee has also recommended lifting the limit on the permitted number of days for renting out per year.\n\nThe local occupancy tax is 5%, and the Lake Placid sales tax is 8%.

They can be absent during the STRO for up to 90 days per calendar year. Home sharing includes duplexes and qualified accessory dwelling units if the host resides on site.\nTier 3 - Whole Home Excluding Mission Beach: This is when a property is rented for more than 20 days a year, and the owner or permanent resident is not on site.

The total number of licenses will not exceed 30% of the Mission Beach Community Planning Area, and the minimum stay per guest is two nights.\nSan Diego limits non-owner occupied short-term rentals, so investors should verify whether they are eligible before buying an Airbnb property in the city.\n\nSince the current San Diego short-term rental laws are new, the license application period will open on October 3rd, 2022, and close on November 30th, 2022, for Tier 3 and Tier 4 applications. Tier 3 and Tier 4 licenses will be assigned through a lottery process, established by the Office of the City Treasurer, if the number of applications exceeds the number of available licenses according to the aforementioned regulations. Priority will be given to good actors, defined as hosts who have paid taxes, have recent booking activity, and have fewer than three verifiable complaints.

What you might not know is that at this time, the State of Connecticut has no legislation in place regulating short term rentals statewide. Historically, Groton hasn’t regulated them either. So to keep up with the demand, regulation of these properties must be done through a change to our zoning regulations or development of a new town ordinance.\nZoning Regulations provide rules about how a piece of land or property can be used, how large a building can be, whether a business can be opened on a property, as well as establishing parking, landscaping and lighting requirements. Zoning laws govern issues like site construction, hours of operation, parking requirements, signs, garbage collection, and the like. Zoning could specify which districts allow STRs and can specify how STRs are approved. Zoning can require that a permit is issued to the property, not the operator, and zoning can dictate enforcement through the zoning enforcement officer. Zoning regulations are adopted by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the regulations will only apply to new uses.\nA Town Ordinance, on the other hand, would apply to both new STRs and those already operating. It would eliminate the potential for existing properties to claim grandfathered rights to operate STRs and would issue a license to the operator and not the property. An ordinance would also put nuisance enforcement in the hands of the Police. An ordinance is adopted by the Town Council.\nWhether we decide on new zoning or an ordinance, to develop these new regulations for STR's Groton is engaging the Horsley Witten Group to seek solutions that protect public interests and meet the needs of all residents. We strive to create regulations that generate inclusive opportunities for local wealth-creation, while still balancing the needs of all members of the community.",

This eliminates the prior exemption for rentals of more than 30 days. This means that visitors will continue to pay lodgers' tax on their rental after 30 days in the same rental unless they can prove that they are making Santa Fe their permanent, tax-paying residence.

An operator could be a person, a couple, a group, or even a corporate entity like an LLC. When applying for an operator license, you must provide the specific addresses of the units you plan to manage.\n\nIn general, most operators are allowed to manage two units: their primary residence and one additional unit that they do not live in. The primary unit can be an attached or detached accessory dwelling unit (ADU or DADU) or an \"in-law\" apartment within a larger housing unit. Rented rooms without their own kitchens and bathrooms are not counted towards the operator's two units and do not require an additional license. Instead, they are covered by the STR operator's primary or secondary residence license. For instance, if you offer three rooms for rent in your house, you only need to obtain an STR license for your primary residence, and all three rooms will be covered by that single license.\n\nIf you have been legally operating short-term rental units before September 30, 2017, some special provisions apply. If you operate one or more legacy units (in line with the limitations of the STR ordinance), you must provide documentation demonstrating its use as a short-term rental within the 12-month period before September 30, 2017.

A single-family dwelling, or a residential dwelling unit in a multi-unit structure, condominium, cooperative, timeshare or similar joint property ownership arrangement that is rented for a fee for less than 28 consecutive days. “Short-term rental” includes vacation rentals.\n“Short-term rental” does not include: (a) a dwelling that is used for any non-residential purpose, including educational, health care, retail, restaurant, banquet space, event center or other similar uses; (b) a bed and breakfast establishment as defined in Section 2 of the Bed and Breakfast Act; or (c) transient accommodations, including hotels and motels that are not classified as residential property for real property taxation purposes.\nOrdinance No. 22-02 dated January 11, 2022, is available for viewing on the City’s website",

Paying on time avoids penalties and interest. Room taxes remaining unpaid may result in a lien placed on the property.

    "Policy point 1:": "To comply with Richmond’s new regulatory scheme for short-term rentals, hosts must meet several requirements.\n\nFirst, hosts must obtain a Certificate of Zoning Compliance (CZC) for Short-Term Rental, also known as a Short-Term Rental Permit. This certificate requires a payment of $300, which covers administrative, monitoring, and enforcement costs. Each certificate is valid from January 1st until December 31st of the following year, regardless of when the certificate is issued. Hosts must obtain and renew this certificate to operate a short-term rental property within the Richmond city limits. Additionally, any advertisements for the property must include a valid CZC posting.\n\nSecond, hosts must own the property that they are offering as a short-term rental. The property must be the host’s primary residence, meaning that the host resides there for at least 185 days each calendar year. Creating a short-term rental from a property that the host is currently leasing from a landlord or a property at which the host does not reside for at least 185 days each year would violate the new regulatory scheme.\n\nThird, the number of guests occupying the short-term rental is limited to two adult renters per available “sleeping room”. The regulations cap the amount of possible “sleeping rooms” for a specific property at five, although there may be additional occupancy limitations depending on the specific building and zoning codes for the property in question.\n\nFourth, hosts must ensure that the property or rented space complies with the Virginia Residential Construction Code and fire extinguisher provisions, and that carbon monoxide detectors are present in all bedrooms, kitchens, and any other room used for cooking or sleeping.\n\nFifth, short-term renters are not allowed to create or permit a large gathering, event, or party at the property consisting of attendees that are not occupying the “sleeping rooms” of the property. This means that a short-term rental cannot be used for weddings, receptions, or other events. There are additional permitting requirements under different regulatory structures for these types of events.\n\nNotably, Richmond does not place restrictions on “hosted” versus “unhosted” stays, although the regulations do refer to the distinction. A whole house rental constitutes an unhosted stay since the short-term renter is temporarily granted the right to make use of the entire house without the host being present. Conversely, a hosted stay is the rental of a room or a portion of the residence with the host remaining in residence for the duration of the stay. Within the Richmond city limits, there is no requirement for a host to remain on-site, thus permitting both hosted and unhosted stays of short-term guests.\n\nLastly, Richmond does not require a short-term rental host to provide or ensure adequate parking for a guest or guests throughout their stay.",

This has become increasingly popular in the United States, with many property owners and tenants using online platforms such as Airbnb, Craigslist, Expedia, FlipKey, HomeAway, TripAdvisor, and VRBO to list their properties for short-term rental.\n\nHowever, home sharing is subject to the same taxation requirements as hotels and other businesses. Across the country, local authorities are working to ensure that all taxes are assessed and collected fairly from home-sharing operators. This involves identifying properties involved in home sharing and collecting any taxes due.\n\nIn the city of Alexandria, Virginia, property owners and managers who operate short-term residential rentals are required to complete a free registration process. This includes reporting each platform used to advertise the property, and submitting a Transient Lodging Tax Return on a monthly basis, which must include the property addresses and gross receipts for all accommodations.\n\nAs of October 1, 2022, accommodations intermediaries (such as Airbnb) are required to submit this information to the city on behalf of property owners and managers. However, if an operator does not use an intermediary, they are responsible for collecting and remitting taxes directly to the city each month.\n\nThe City of Alexandria Code Section 3-2-152 also requires the operator of each short-term residential property to register with the Department of Finance on an annual basis. This means that all property owners and managers must register and complete the annual registration process.\n\nOverall, home sharing can be a great way to earn extra income, but it is important to comply with all relevant tax and registration requirements. By doing so, property owners and managers can help ensure a fair and level playing field for all businesses in the hospitality industry.",

Instead, they allow the city to monitor short-term rental properties and set certain standards to protect the integrity of Denton neighborhoods and the safety of the community.\n\nIn addition to the registration fee, short-term rentals are also required to pay a monthly hotel occupancy tax. This tax is calculated based on the rental income and is payable to the city on a monthly basis.\n\nOverall, the regulations for short-term rentals in Denton aim to strike a balance between allowing property owners to offer these types of accommodations while also protecting the interests of the wider community.",

The CUP is an amendment to the zoning of the property and is subject to conditions imposed by the City Council, such as a maximum guest occupancy. Once approved, the STR is required to pay both state and city hotel occupancy taxes, as well as comply with all city ordinances, including septic compliance, parking requirements, noise mitigation, and dark sky lighting.\n\nBefore applying for a CUP, property owners should ensure they have adequate parking and emergency procedures in place, and consider how the STR will affect neighboring properties. The city's Planning Department recommends that applicants approach their neighbors prior to submitting their application to address any concerns and assess the neighborhood's appropriateness for an STR.\n\nThe CUP application process typically takes 45 to 60 days, during which time the City Planner will notify neighbors within 200 feet of the property of the owner's intention to receive a CUP.

    "Policy point 1:": "Short-term rentals (STR) are one- or two-family dwellings that are rented for overnight lodging for less than 30 days at a time. Examples of STRs include homes, apartments, and condominiums that are rented out for short periods of time. In Seabrook, Texas, where these regulations apply, hotels, bed and breakfasts, apartment unit rentals, or dwellings that are rented for a period longer than 30 days are not considered short-term rentals.\n\nAll short-term rentals in Seabrook city limits must be permitted and inspected. This means that any one- or two-family dwelling advertised as a short-term rental on home-sharing websites such as Airbnb, VRBO, HomeAway, etc. must be permitted before the advertisement is posted. A current and valid Short-Term Rental Permit is required for all STRs within the city limits.\n\nTo obtain a permit, applicants must complete an online STR Permit Application Form, which requires the submission of several documents and a $300 permit fee. The required documents include contact information for the owner(s), operator(s), and agent(s) of the STR, emergency contact information, a floor plan that identifies sleeping areas, evacuation routes, and the location of fire extinguishers, smoke alarms, and carbon monoxide detectors, a tenant information card/brochure, and a sworn statement that the owner will comply with all requirements of the article, including city codes, regulations, and annual inspections of required fire extinguishers.\n\nAll short-term rentals in Seabrook are also subject to a 7% hotel occupancy tax, which must be paid via credit card using Seabrook's Easy Pay system. Any property owner delinquent and/or owing City of Seabrook fees, including hotel occupancy tax, sanitation or water service fees, will be prohibited from registering a short-term rental until such time as payment or acceptable resolution is approved by the City of Seabrook finance department.\n\nShort-term rentals are also subject to inspection to ensure compliance with city ordinances, particularly those regarding fire safety. An initial inspection is conducted as part of the issuance of a new Short-Term Rental Permit, and additional inspections may be performed upon report or suspicion of a violation.\n\nShort-Term Rental Permits are not transferable to a new property owner. A new owner must apply for a permit within 60 days from the closing date of the purchase or any other conveyance of ownership. Failure to apply for a permit within this time frame may result in the revocation or non-renewal of an existing Short-Term Rental Permit or the denial of a new Short-Term Rental registration.\n\nFinally, unless revoked earlier pursuant to the article, the initial Short-Term Rental Permit expires 24 months from the date of issuance, and subsequent renewals are on an annual calendar year basis. Permit holders must apply for renewal prior to December 31.",
